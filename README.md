### About Me
👨‍💻 - I’m Jerry Nguyen, fascinated by technology and more particularly by Website Development. I never stop learning 📚 and I spend most of my time with Front End framework like NextJS🤝 

📂 - I’m using Github to share my experimentations in a project. In other words, it serves as a basis for attempts and the application of concepts in order to express my creative mind and my willingness to innovate 🎯.

📆 - My current project is called Reddis, a replication of Reddit with fullstack (NextJS for FrontEnd and Express for BackEnd) but without Machine Learning.

📫 - Feel free to contact and share with me!
